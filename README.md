## Brand Logos

If you add/find a brand that we do not have logos for, you can submit logos using a Pull Request from the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/MarksMakerSpace/filament-profiles/pulls) page.

Since label printers are generally fairly low resolution we have split the logos into two different files for each brand. One for **web** and one for **label** as described below. 

### **Web Logo Requirements**

**File Naming:**
Use the format: `brandname-web.png`

* All lowercase
* Replace underscores `_` and spaces `" "` with hyphens `"-"`
* Examples:

  * `add:north` ‚Üí `addnorth-web.png`
  * `Atomic Filament` ‚Üí `atomic-filament-web.png`

**NOTE:** You can verify the file name by clicking on the brand in the [Brands](https://3dfilamentprofiles.com/brands) page and finding the `brandname` in the URL it takes you to. For example, the URL for Bambu Lab is:
`https://3dfilamentprofiles.com/defaults/bambu-lab`
So the `brandname` is `bambu-lab`.

**Specifications:**

* **Width:** 240 px
* **File Format:** PNG
* **Background:** Transparent
* **Color:** Use the brand‚Äôs original logo colors
* **Aspect Ratio:** 1:1 is acceptable, but a wider version is preferred if possible

### **Label Logo Requirements**

**File Naming:**
Use the format: `brandname.png`

* All lowercase
* Replace underscores `_` and spaces `" "` with hyphens `"-"`
* Examples:

  * `add:north` ‚Üí `addnorth.png`
  * `Atomic Filament` ‚Üí `atomic-filament.png`

**Specifications:**

* **Width:** 400 px
* **File Format:** PNG
* **Background:** Transparent
* **Color:** Black on white for high contrast (greyscale may be acceptable for some logos)
* **Note:** If the logo has thin lines, increase line weight or contrast to improve visibility
* **Aspect Ratio:** Aim for a wide layout, preferably around 6:1

**Cropping and Cleaning Up the Logo Image (e.g., in Photoshop):**
Make sure the logo is cropped to the correct size, removing any unnecessary transparent pixels around it.
This ensures the final image has clean edges and no extra padding.

In Photoshop (or similar tools), use the crop tool or trim function to automatically remove transparent areas.
This step is important to maintain consistent sizing and alignment across all logo assets.

---

**Start by finding a high-resolution vector file or image of the logo.**
The manufacturer's homepage is often a good place to begin, as it may provide an SVG or high-resolution PNG file.
For example: [https://bambulab.com/assets/logo.svg](https://bambulab.com/assets/logo.svg)

You can open and edit SVG files using software like Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop.

Alternatively, you can use online tools to convert formats:

* https://svgtopng.com
* https://cloudconvert.com/webp-to-png

You can then refine or edit the image using free software such as GIMP or Paint.NET.

**Alternatively, you can try searching for a high-resolution image using a search engine.**
Sometimes you‚Äôll even find a PNG file with a transparent background.
However, for smaller or lesser-known brands, only low-quality JPG images may be available. In such cases, some cleanup and enhancement may be necessary.

**You can also improve your search results by including keywords like "filament" and/or "logo" in your search query.**
For example: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=polymaker+filament+logo&t=h_&iar=images
